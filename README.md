# Multivariate Analysis: Mutiple Linear Regression

The repository contains a simple demonstration of a multivariate technique, specifically - multiple linear regression. It is a simple walkthrough using a dataset that can be found
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/karthickveerakumar/startup-logistic-regression).

The data undergoes the following:
 - Normality tests for predictors
 - Multicolliniearity test for numerical predictors
 - Label Encoding categorical variables and Standardizing numerical ones.
 - Homogenous test for residuals

The analysis showcases  how multiple linear regression can be implemented and the steps to achieve desired results.
